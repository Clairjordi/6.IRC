## Protocole IRC
- The IRC protocol uses a system of servers and clients to allow users to connect to chat channels in real time.
- IRC clients can connect to an IRC server using a username and password. Users can join chat channels or chat privately with other users connected to the same server.
- IRC commands are used to perform actions, such as joining a channel, leaving a channel, sending a private message, etc.
- IRC channels are real-time chat rooms where users can chat in groups.
- IRC channel operators (or "ops") are users who have special privileges on a channel, such as kicking out other users or changing channel settings.
